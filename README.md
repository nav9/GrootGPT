# GrootGPT  
A cute little chat assistant generated by prompting ChatGPT. The profile images were generated using Stable Diffusion Online. It allows you to have an enthralling conversation with Groot. This program was created as an attempt to see how much of a program could be created by prompting OpenAI's Chat GPT. Yes, the entire HTML and JavaScript on this website was generated by Chat GPT. The profile icons were generated via Stable Diffusion Online and scaled in GIMP manually. The program does not use GPT to generate outputs. GPT was only used to build and refine the code that runs this page. The use of a trivial sentiment-analysis function will result in Groot replying with emoticons. Eg: If you use a sentence containing words like "happy" or "sad".  
It took just around 4 hours to create this project. It showcases the amazing ability of Generative Pretrained Transformers and Stable Diffusion.
